## Program your AI to buy your car

You have been working for a year as a data expert and have saved enough money
to buy a car. As a data expert and being quite thrifty, you
want to get your money's worth !!!
Imagine you also have data from the CarDekho cars website, which
contains information on a wide variety of cars, including their prices. You
realize you can use this data to make sure you get a good deal
on a new car. In particular, you can determine exactly how much you
should pay for a specific type of car. This can be particularly useful if you
meet a tough car salesman!
But the question is how do you use the data to determine how much you
should pay?
